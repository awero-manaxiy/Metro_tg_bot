# Metro_tg_bot
This is a telegram bot that helps users build routes in Moscow Metro. The bot provides the shortest path between two stations as well as the estimated travel time.

I created this bot solely for the purposes of education. Files in data directory were parsed from [the official map of Moscow Metro](https://mosmetro.ru/metro-map)
